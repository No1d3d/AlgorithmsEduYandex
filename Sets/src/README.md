TASK 1
For a given list of integer numbers (0 <= size <= 100000), determine the number of unique numbers in it 

TASK 2
For two given list of integer numbers (0 <= size of list 1 or list 2 <= 10000), determine the intersecting (similar) elements in them and put them out in the ascending order.

TASK 3
Anya and Borya love to play multi-colored cubes, and each of them has its own set, and in
each set all the cubes are different in color. One day, the children wondered how much
There are colors such that cubes of each color are present in both sets. To do this,
they numbered all the colors with random numbers. That's when their enthusiasm ran out, so you're
invited to help them with the rest. A number of any color is an integer between 0 and 10.

Input format:
In the first line of the input file, the numbers N and M are written - the number of cubes for Anya and Borya
, respectively. In the next N lines, the color numbers of Anya's cubes are set. In the last M
lines are the color numbers of the Bori cubes.

Output format:
Print first the number and then the ascending numbers of colors such
that cubes of each color are in both sets, then the number and
ascending numbers of the remaining colors for Anya, then the number and
ascending numbers of the remaining colors for Borya.

TASK 4
Given a text file, count unique words in it. A word is defined by a sequence of non-space symbols.
Words are separated by a single or several space symbols. Words that are located in the end of a "sentence"
or near the punctuation signs, should be read without the punctuation sign (.,;:!?\|/'"")

TASK 5
Give 3 digits (0 <= each number <= 9) and number n (0 <= n <= 10000),
determine the number of digits that need to be added to the first three input digits
to be able to output (replicate) number n.

Example 1:
INPUT:
    1 2 3
    1223
OUTPUT:
    0 (as one can create number 1223 with 1, 2 and 3)


Example 2:
INPUT:
    1 4 0 
    1223
OUTPUT:
    2 (as digits 2 and 3 need to be present in the digits set to be able to output 1223)

TASK 6
Given two strings consisting of only CAPITAL ENGLISH LETTERS, determine the number of pairs (with duplicates) from string 2 that can be found in string 1.

Example:
    ABBACAB
    BCABB

Output: 4

pairs in string 1: AB BB BA AC CA AB
pairs in string 2: BC CA AB BB

    picking out pairs from s2, we can see that there is no BC in s1, one CA in s1, two AB in s1, one BB in s1.
    0 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 4;

pairs of
