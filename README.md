This repository contains all the tasks from Yandex Algorithm Training courses that I was able to complete.

It is an ongoing repository, so the new tasks will be added as soon as I complete them.
It is also necessary to clarify that the purpose of this repository IS NOT to take all the tasks from Yandex courses and show the solutions to everybody (My solutions might not be the best in terms of speed and memory!). The real purpose is to gather up the materials that I need to study to get better in solving typical tasks for the job interviews and to give the others, willing to get better in the said topic, some new (maybe not) algorithms to try to code. All the tasks and lecture materials can be found here: https://yandex.ru/yaintern/training#courses.

GTTA GIT GUD!!!
