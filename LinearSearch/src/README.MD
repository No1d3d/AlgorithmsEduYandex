TASK 1 
Given a vector of integer values, output YES if it is strictly ascending, NO if not

TASK 2
Given a vector of integer values, output the type of sequence it belongs to
CONSTANT - all values of the vector are equal
ASCENDING - all values are ascending
WEAKLY ASCENDING - all values are ascending or equal to the previous ones
DESCENDING - all values are descending
WEAKLY DESCENDING - all values are descending or equal to the previous ones
RANDOM - the values of the vector do not fit to either one of the previous patterns

TASK 3
You recieve a number n, a length of an array, then n elements of an array, and then a number f.
In the given array of length n, find a value closest to number f

TASK 4
In a given vector, put out the number of elements that are bigger than both their left and right neighbors

TASK 5
Vasiliy took part in a dookie throwing competition. There were a lot of participants
and he did not remember the order of the participants and the place when it was his turn to throw.
He only remembered that the number of meters he threw the dookie ended with number 5,
one of the first three winning contestants took his turn right before Vasiliy,
and the participant that took his turn right after Vasiliy, could not throw further than him.
What is the highest place Vasiliy could have gotten in that competition? 

TASK 6
For a given vector, determine if it is symmetrical. 
If not, output the least number of elements needed to be added 
in the back to make it symmetrical and what are these elements.

TASK 9
You need to put out a MINESWEEPER game field. You are given 3 numbers:
the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of mines on a field.
if the number of mines is not 0, you are also given the coordinates of each mine on the field.
You should only output a field for the game of the given configuration.

-----THE VALUES ARE GIVEN IN THE RIGHT WAY, YOU DO NOT NEED TO PROOF CHECK VALUES!!!-----
